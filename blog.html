    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
    <p>Ans: Var can be accessed through the whole script of a js file. That's why its' scope is called global scope. It can be used before initialization. It can be declared more than once within the same script. variable declared with var will be hoisted .<br>

    let cannot be used before the initialization. Its' scope is called block scope. It can be used only with in block scope or in function scope. Outside of the block it cannot be accessed. It cannot be declared with the same value more than once. But the value of the variable declared with the let can be changed. variable declared with let are also hoisted but not initialized. let allows reassignment of value.

    const also cannot be used before initialization. It also posses block scope. out side of the block or function scope it cannot be accessed. It didn't allow reassignment of value.The value within const cannot be changed. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
    <p> Ans: Null is a value that doesn't possess anything else. It is given deliberately when there is no value to give. On the other hand undefined is used when any data or value is not found or don't know what is the actual value is. undefined is used on unintentional behavior of data.<br>
        there are 8 ways to get Undefined :<br>
        1.Variable that is not initialized will give undefined. <br>
        2.Function with no return. <br>
        3.Parameter that is not passed will be undefined. <br>
        4.If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. <br>
        5.Property that doesn't exists on object will give undefined. <br>
        6.Accessing array elements outside of the index range will give undefined. <br>
        7.Deleting an element inside an array will create undefined . <br>
        8.Set a value directly to undefined.

    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
    <p> Ans: The full form of REST API is Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. Those are some set of rules that ensure how the data should passes through internet from web page to server. Those are not any kind of protocol, they are simply designed for proper functioning of webs services.</p>
